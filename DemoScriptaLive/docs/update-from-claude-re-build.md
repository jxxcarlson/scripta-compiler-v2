# Build System Update - Fixed by Claude

## Date: 2025-09-18

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Elm Compilation Errors
The compiler API had breaking changes where `DisplaySettings` was moved from `Generic.Compiler` to `ScriptaV2.Settings` and gained a new `numberToLevel` field.

**Files Fixed:**
- `src/Model.elm` - Updated import and added missing field
- `src/Common/Model.elm` - Updated import and added missing field
- `src/MainTauri.elm` - Fixed `makeSettings` function calls
- `src/MainLocal.elm` - Fixed `makeSettings` function calls
- `src/MainSQLite.elm` - Fixed `makeSettings` function calls

### 2. Rust/Tauri Build Failure
The Rust failure was caused by cached build paths from the old directory name (`DemoScripta` → `DemoScriptaLive`).

**Solution:** Run `cargo clean` in the `src-tauri` directory to clear cached paths.

## Current Build Status

### ✅ Working Builds
- **`npm run build-desktop`** - Tauri desktop app (Elm compiles, app runs, only DMG bundling fails)
- **`npm run build-live`** - LocalStorage web version
- **`npm run build-live-sqlite`** - SQLite web version

### ❌ Still Has Issues
- **`npm run build-elm`** - Legacy/standard version (src/Main.elm) has additional API mismatches

## How to Run the Desktop App

**Production build:**
```bash
./src-tauri/target/release/scripta-live
```

**Development with hot reload:**
```bash
npm run dev-desktop
```

## Build Commands Summary

```bash
# Web versions
npm run build-live         # LocalStorage version
npm run build-live-sqlite  # SQLite web version

# Desktop versions
npm run dev-desktop        # Dev mode with hot reload
npm run build-desktop      # Production build

# Clean rebuild if needed
cd src-tauri && cargo clean
npm run build-desktop
```

## Technical Details

The successful Tauri app:
- Initializes SQLite database at `~/Library/Application Support/com.scripta.live/scripta.db`
- Loads and saves documents correctly
- Responds to all commands properly
- Binary location: `src-tauri/target/release/scripta-live` (~13.9 MB)

The only remaining minor issue is the DMG bundling step for creating the macOS installer, which is a packaging issue, not a build failure.
