# About Scripta Live

Scripta is a markup language much like LaTeX, but with a simplified, ergonomic syntax.
Better yet: what you write (here, on the left) is rendered
[i instantaneously ] in the right-hand window pane. No setup required.
Just click the "New" button and start writing.

- Your documents are saved in the browser's local storage.  If you refresh the
browser or close it and come back to it later, it weill be there, waiting for you..

- Use the megaphone icon on the right to report bugs, ask questions, and make suggestions.

- Scripta documents can be exported to standard LaTeX.  If there are no images
in the document, it can be turned into a pdf file using `pdflatex`.  Otherwise,
use the downloadable shell script — get it by clicking on the button  [blue Download Script],
lower right corner.  We
will soon provide a simpler solution.


# Examples

| mathmacros
secpder:  frac(partial^2 #1, partial #2^2)
nat:    mathbb N
reals: mathbb R
pder:  frac(partial #1, partial #2)
set:    \\{ #1 \\}
sett:   \\{ #1 \\ | \\ #2 \\}

Pythagoras said: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

This will be on the test:

| equation
int_0^1 x^n dx = frac(1,n+1)


Both of the above equalities were written using an `equation` block.  If you look
at the source text you will see that [eqref wave-equation] an [u argument] `numbered` and
a property, namely  `label:wave-equation`. That property is used for cross-referencing: we say `[eqref wave-equation]` to make a hot link to [eqref wave-equation].  Click on it now
to see what happens.

Here is an [u aligned] block:

| aligned
nat &= set("positive whole numbers and zero")
nat &= sett(n " is a whole number", n > 0)


| equation
\\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 1 \\\\
1 & 2
\\end{pmatrix}
\\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 1 \\\\
1 & 2
\\end{pmatrix}
=
\\begin{pmatrix}
5 & 4 \\\\
4 & 5
\\end{pmatrix}


[b Note:] The equation [eqref wave-equation] is the wave equation in four dimensions —
three of space and one of time.

The Scripta Markup Language

Scripta is a markup language for making documents with equations and images:

| equation
int_0^1 x^n dx = frac(1, n + 1)

Here is how we wrote it:

| code
| equation
int_0^1 x^n dx = frac(1, n + 1)

In TeX, we would have written

| code
\\begin{equation}
\\int_0^1 x^n dx = \\frac{1, n + 1}
\\end{equation}

A Scripta document

If you already know TeX or LaTeX, you already know how to do $90^\u{0003}%$ guess most of what you need to know:

. Write simple subscripts as in `x_1` and compliadted ones as in `x_{32}`

secpder:  frac(partial^2 #1, partial #2^2)
nat:    mathbb N
reals: mathbb R

#!/bin/bash

 # Usage:
 #
 # sh ./process_images.sh <input_file> : gives a way
 #
 # Purpose: process LaTeX exported from scripta files that contain images,
 # first creating a corresponding LaTeX file, then
 # a pdf file.
 #
 # Prerequisite software installation:
 # - ImageMagick (for converting images to EPS)
 # - pdflatex (for making PDFs LaTeX files)
 #
 # Setup:
 # Make a folder call "tex" and make a subfolder "image" in it.
 # Put this script in the "tex" folder.
 # Put your file downloaded from Scripta Live or Scripta.io in the "tex" folder.
 # Run the script with the same filename as an argument: `sh ./process_file.sh myfile.tex`
 #
 # Plans:
 # This work will be automated in the near future, so that you can just
 # Press a button to do all the work
 #
 # Detail: the script processes its inputs follows:
 # First, it examines the file, finding all urls pointing to images (JPEG or PNG).
 # Next, it downloads the corresponding images, constructing a filename for each
 # image based on its URL, and converts them to EPS format using ImageMagick.
 # These images are then stored in the directory "./image". The URLS in the
 # original LaTeX file are replaced with the local EPS filenames.
