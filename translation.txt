Anharmonic Oscillator

[tags jxxcarlson:anharmonic-oscillator.1]



The classical anharmonic oscillator is one with a "non-linear spring". By this we mean that the standard force law $F = -kx$ has additional terms, e.g., $F = -kx - ell x^3$.  In this case the corresponding potential is a quartic: 


| equation
V(x) = (1/2)kx^2 + (ell/4)x^4


In this section we study the quantum anharmonic oscillator with a quartic term in the potential.  Our first task is to find the energy of the ground state when a small quartic term is added to the potential.  For this we need some basic perturbation theory.  An approximation to the ground state energy in two ways: (i) by doing a Gaussian integral (ii) by working out the expression $(a + a^dagger)^4$ as a noncommutative polynomial using the harmonic oscillator operator calculus.

## Perturbation theory

Let us suppose given a quantum mechanical system with Hamiltonian of the form $H = H_0 + epsilon V$, where a complete set of non-degenerate eigenstates for $H_0$ is known.  Let us call these states $psi^{(m)}$. By nondegenerate, we mean that all eigenspaces have dimension one. The second term is a small multiple of an operator which we generally take to be a potential.  We use this setup to find solutions of the time-independent Schroedinger equation $H psi = E psi$ up to terms of order epsilon, where we imagine that true solutions have an expansion $psi = psi_0 + epsilon psi_1 + epsilon^2 psi_2 + cdots$.  Substituting into the Schroedinger equation and ignoring terms in $epsilon^2$ or higher powers, we have

| equation
H_0 psi_0 + epsilon H_0 psi_1 + epsilon V psi_0
=
E_0 psi_0 + epsilon E_0 psi_1 + epsilon E_1 psi_0


The $epsilon^0$ component of this equation is


| equation
H_0 psi_0 = 
E_0 psi_0 


Therefore $psi_0$, the zeroth term in the perturbation expansion, is an eigenfunction of the unperturbed Hamiltonian.  That is, $psi_0 = psi^{(m)}$ up to a constant.  

The $epsilon^1$ component of the equation reads

| equation
\label{foperturbationequation}
H_0 psi_1 + V psi_0
=
E_0 psi_1 +  E_1 psi_0


Take the inner product with $psi_0$:

| equation
langle psi_0 | H_0  | psi_1 rangle +  langle psi_0  | V | psi_0 rangle
=
E_0 langle psi_0  |  psi_1 rangle +  E_1 langle psi_0  |  psi_0 rangle


Because $psi_0$ is an eigenfunction of $H_0$, the first term on the left is equal to the first term on the right, so that

| equation
\label{perturbation-of-energy}
E_1 = frac( langle psi_0 | V | psi_0 rangle, || psi_0 ||^2 )


In other words, if $E^{(m)}$ is the energy of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, then the energy of the corresponding state of the perturbed system is $E^{(m)} + epsilon Delta E^{(m)}$, where

| equation
\label{perturbation-of-En}
Delta E^{(m)} = frac(langle psi^{(m)} | V | psi^{(m)} rangle , || psi^{(m)} ||^2 )


To find the wave functions for the perturbed system, assume that $psi_0 = psi^{(n)}$ and take the inner product of [ref foperturbationequation] with $psi^{(m)}$ for $m ne n$.  One obtains

| equation
langle psi^{(m)} | H_0 | psi_1 rangle + langle psi^{(m)} | V | psi_0 rangle
=
E_0 langle psi^{(m)} | psi_1 rangle + E_1 langle psi^{(m)} | psi_0 rangle


The first term on the left is $E_m langle psi^{(m)} | psi_1 rangle$ and the last term on the right vanishes, so that we obtain

| equation
\label{perturbation-fourier-coefficients}
langle psi^{(m)} | psi_1 rangle
= frac(langle psi^{(m)} | V | psi_1 rangle, E_0 - E_m)


The numbers are the Fourier coefficients of the expansion of $psi$:

| equation
\label{perturbation-fourier-expansion}
psi = psi^{(n)} 
+ epsilon sum_{m ne n} frac(langle psi^{(n)} | V | psi^{(m)} rangle,  E^{(n)} - E^{(m)}  ) psi^{(m)} 


## Quartic perturbation by Gaussian integrals


Let us consider a quartic perturbation of the harmonic oscillator, where 

| equation
H_0 = frac(1, 2m)(hat p^2 + m^2 omega^2 x^2) +  lambda g x^4,


where $lambda$ is a small dimensionless parameter.  Now $p^2/2m$ is a kinetic energy term, so $[gx^4] = [E]$, where $E$ is an energy and $[  ]$ means "units of". Solving, we have $[g] = [Ex^{-4}]$.  Let us try to cook up a "natural value" for $g$.  A natural energy is the zero point energy of the oscillator, $omega hbar/2$.  In addition, we need a natural length scale for $x$.  To this end, consider the ground state wave function, which is proportional to $e^{-m omega x^2/2 hbar}$.  Solve for $m omega x^2/2 hbar = 1$. One obtains $x_0^2 = 2 hbar/m omega$. At distance $x = x_0$, the value of the wave function has decreased from its maximum at $x = 0$ by a factor of $1/e$. Thus a natural choice is 

| equation
g = frac(omega hbar, 2) \left(frac(2 hbar, m omega)\right)^{-2} = frac(m^2 omega^3, 8 hbar)


Writing $H= H_0 + lambda g x^4$, we find ourselves in the context of perturbation theory. Then the shift in the $n$-th energy level is given by 

| equation
\label{DeltaEn}
Delta E_n = lambda g langle psi_n | x^4 | psi_n rangle ,


and where the $psi_n$ are normalized wave functions for the harmonic oscillator.  Referring to the definition of the normalized ground state wave function, we find that the shift in energy levels is given by a Gaussian integral:

| equation
Delta E_0 = lambda g \left(frac(m omega, pi hbar)\right)^{ 1/2 } int_{-infty}^infty x^4 e^{-m omega x^2 / hbar} dx


The integral to be evaluated has the form

| equation
I_2 = int_{-infty}^infty x^2 e^{-alpha x^2} dx


To compute it, recall that 

| equation
int_{-infty}^infty e^{-alpha x^2} dx 
= \left( frac(pi, alpha) \right)^{1/2}


Now compare this derivative computation

| equation
frac(d, d alpha) int_{-infty}^infty e^{-alpha x^2} dx = - int_{-infty}^infty x^2 e^{-alpha x^2} dx


with this one:

| equation
frac(d, d alpha) \left(frac(pi, alpha)\right)^{1/2} = -frac(1, 2) \left(frac(pi,  alpha^3 ) \right)^{1/2}


to conclude that

| equation
int_{-infty}^infty x^2 e^{-alpha x^2} dx =  frac(1, 2) \left(frac(pi,  alpha^3 ) \right)^{1/2}


Similarly, one obtains

| equation
int_{-infty}^infty x^4 e^{-alpha x^2} dx =  frac(3, 4) \left(frac(pi,  alpha^5 ) \right)^{1/2}


Working through the constants, one obtains at long last the
first order energy shift:

| equation
\label{anharmonic_correction}
Delta E_0 = frac(3, 16) \left( frac(omega hbar, 2)\right)  lambda


## Quartic perturbation by operator calculus


The operator "multiplication by $x$" can also be written in terms of creation and annihilation operators.  Adding the expressions for these operators in the [ref 225], we find that 

| equation
x = \left[frac( hbar ,  2m omega ) \right]^{1/2} (a + a^dagger )


Substituting this into [ref DeltaEn], we find that

| aligned
\label{aa4}
Delta E_0 &= lambda g \left(frac( hbar ,  2m omega ) \right)^{2} langle psi_0 | ( a + a^dagger )^4 | psi_0 rangle \\
&= lambda frac(1, 16) frac(omega hbar, 2) langle psi_0 | ( a + a^dagger )^4 | psi_0 rangle


The operator $(a + a^dagger)^4$ is a sum of sixteen noncommutative monomials which can be listed in lexicographical order as 

| aligned
& a^dagger a^dagger a^dagger a^dagger \\
& a^dagger a^dagger a^dagger a \\
& a^dagger a^dagger a  a^dagger \\
& a^dagger  a  a^dagger a^dagger \\
& etc


We say that a monomial is in [term normal order] if all of the creation operators appear before the annihilation operators.  In the list above, the first, second, and fourth entries are in normal order.  Using the identity $[a,a^dagger] = 1$, any monomial can be expressed as a sum of monomials in normal order.  One has, for instance, $aa^dagger = a^dagger a + 1$.  Now consider the monomials $M$ that might enter into the formula [ref aa4] with nonzero coefficient.  A bit of reflection tells us that such a monomial must consist of two creation operators and two annihilation operators.  This is because the expression $M psi_0$ must be be a multiple of $psi_0$.  That is, $M$ must raise the eigenvalue twice and also lower it twice. There are six such monomials. The monomial $M$ must also have a creation operator on the right, since otherwise $M psi_0 = 0$.  For essentially the same reasons, it must have an annihilation operator on the left.  This constraint reduces the number of admissible monomials to two: $aa^dagger aa^dagger$ and 
$aaa^dagger a^dagger$.  Let us give the beginning of the computation for the first of these so that you see the pattern.  Then we will state the result. The computation is a kind of game in which we move $a$s to the right using the relation $ a a^dagger = a^dagger a + 1$.  To win the game is to express the monomial as a sum of monomials in normal order.  The first move is $aaa^dagger a^dagger = aa^dagger a a^dagger + aa^dagger$.  After a sequence of such moves, you will find that

| equation
aaa^dagger a^dagger = a^dagger a^dagger  aa + 4a^dagger a + 2


For the second monomial, you will find that

| equation
aa^dagger a a^dagger =  a^dagger a^dagger  aa + 2a^dagger a + 1


We are led to the conclusion that

| equation
(a + a^dagger )^4 = M' + 3,


where $M'$ is a sum of monomials different from 1.
Now think about expressions $langle psi_0 | M | psi_0 rangle$, where
$M$ is a  monomial in normal order.  It is zero if $M ne 1$ and
is 1 if  $M = 1$.  We can therefore read off the value of the perturbation term for the energy:

| equation
Delta E_0 = frac(3, 16) \left( frac(omega hbar, 2)\right)  lambda


This is in agreement with the value computed by doing a Gaussian integral.

| remark
Let $P(a,a^dagger)$ be a polynomial in the creation 
and annihilation operators.  Let $m_M(P)$ be the 
multiplicity with which $M$ appears in the normal 
order expression for $P$. 
Then 
$langle psi_0 | P(a,a^dagger) | psi_0 rangle = m_1(P)$


Note the combinatorial flavor of the computation of the energy shift by this method.  We will encounter it again in the theory of Feynman diagrams.
